//mongooes generates on successful connection and event knows as connected, so we are listening for an event

//slide 35 created the schema, using mongoose we will create schema for our database collection known as userSchema,

//model instances which is next step forward after model. So   
var userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({  //return new schema obj call userSchema
  //coming up with field name and sort of validation on top of it and some constrain 
  //field names username, email, password and its type and constrain are unique to true

  email: {type: String, unique:true},//use obj.notation { } when you have constrain input
  password: String //using key and value pair for password, no use of constrain
});//so now we have userSchema object 

//certain things known as hooks, in this case we are taking help of hook, also helper funciton which is written
//on top of methods() below. Whenever we create schema, we will also specify helper methods and some hook and then we will 
//finally I am able to build/create model as we did below, 
//hook's are nothing but a function which are registered as callback function. simple pre.save hood for encrypting password

//callback function start and cascade of more call back func inside in inside
